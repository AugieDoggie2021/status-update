# Advisory Status Tracker - BMAD Method Docs

This directory captures the working documents that power the BMAD Method workflow for the Advisory Status Tracker project.

- architecture/ - project-specific technical reference material surfaced to the Developer and Architect agents (coding standards, stack choices, source layout).
- prd.md and prd/ - the living product requirements document and any sharded sections generated by the Product Owner agent.
- stories/ - acceptance criteria, story cards, and specification shards that come out of the BMAD story workflows.
- qa/ - quality gates, regression notes, or runbooks produced by QA tasks.

The contents of this folder are safe to edit by hand. Agents can extend them during BMAD workflows; keep commits small and descriptive so the automation remains diff-friendly.
